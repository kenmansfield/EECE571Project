Modern computations, such as multimedia encoding and machine\r\nlearning, can be adjusted to meet the requirements of the user. Such algorithms generally require domain-specific\r\ntechniques developed specifically to fine tune the computation’s performance.\r\nLoop perforation is a technique for improving the performance of approximate computations by reducing the number of\r\niterations executed. An optimization algorithm identifies tunable loops that respond well to perforation and automatically\r\ngenerates variants of approximate computations. The result is a set of ideal perforation rates for each of the tunable\r\nloops that return significant speedups while maintaining sufficient accuracy. Perforation is performed by an LLVM\r\ncompiler pass which modifies the method in which the induction variable is incremented in loops such that entire\r\niterations are skipped. The implementation is evaluated by applying code perforation to applications contained within the\r\nPARSEC benchmark suite. Results show that significant speedups in code execution time are achievable while\r\nmaintaining reasonable accuracy.\r\n\r\n> Index Terms—C++, Python, Compilers, Approximate Computing, LLVM.\r\n\r\n[Final Report PDF](Ken Mansfield - EECE571p - Final Report.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis project is split into two repositories, this repository is the C++ LLVM pass. \r\n\r\n[This repository is the Python automation script plus test benchmarks](https://github.com/kenmansfield/EECE571Project-Pass)\r\n",
